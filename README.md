# Assignment1
The original package was called Binary Tree, i changed this to DAG and it uploaded as a 
new file, rather than updating my existing one. 

I want to build on my first assignment, but to help me distinguish between them I will be
using strings as keys rather than integers.

I will need a way to keep track of the parents, if i need to keep adding parents an
arraylist is the best way to do this. 
I will do a very simple version of LCA taking help from other students in my course, 
and will add new tests and new code when i see areas where errors could occur.
Obvious areas would include 
1)null nodes
2)non existing nodes
3)the node not being acyclic, could end up in an infinite loop trying to find a node.
